# rssi-api
Compose app to get device and wifi details such as imei, wifi name, ssid and rssi. 

The app will work somewhat on android api 33. 

### The runtime permissions aren't working consistantly so after first launch and accepting permmisions may need to close and reopen app. 

App uses compose, hilt, flow and mvvm architecture. 

A few improvements may need to be donw but this is what i could do given the time constraint on my side.
