# rssi-api
Compose app to get device and wifi details such as imei, wifi name, ssid and rssi. 

The app will work somewhat on android api 33. 

### The runtime permissions aren't working consistantly so after first launch and accepting permmisions may need to close and reopen app. 

App should show notifications but that doesn't seem to be working.

App uses compose, hilt, flow and mvvm architecture. 

A few improvements may need to be donw but this is what i could do given the time constraint on my side.
